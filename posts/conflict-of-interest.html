<h2>DCC Conflict of Interest Code</h2>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Special rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Under review</p>

<p>California law requires all state and local government agencies to establish and follow a Conflict of Interest Code. These codes require agency officials who routinely participate in decisions to publicly disclose personal financial information. They designate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which employee positions must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests</li>

<li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt a Conflict of Interest Code.</p>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code helps identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest.
