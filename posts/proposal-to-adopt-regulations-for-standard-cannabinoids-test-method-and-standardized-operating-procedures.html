<p><strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp; Accepting public comments through May 23, 2023</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to adopt regulations to&nbsp;implement and make specific Business and Professions Code section 26100(f)(2) pertaining to the establishment of a standard cannabinoids test method, including standardized operating procedures, that shall be utilized by all licensed testing laboratories in California. Through the proposed regulations, the DCC aims to ensure all licensed&nbsp;laboratories are using the same standardized cannabinoid&nbsp;test&nbsp;method which will ensure consumers receive accurate and consistent information regarding the cannabinoid content of the cannabis and cannabis product they use or consume.</p>
