<h2><strong>Proposal to adopt regulations for large cultivation licenses and conversion to large </strong>and <strong>medium licenses</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Regular rulemaking&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;Filed October 13, 2022 and currently under review</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to adopt regulations to&nbsp;implement, interpret, and make specific requirements for obtaining a Large Cultivation License under MAUCRSA. These regulations also provide a pathway for existing licensees to convert to a Large Cultivation License once the license type becomes available on January 1, 2023. Additionally, the regulations provide a pathway for existing licensees to convert to Medium Cultivation Licenses once the limitation on the number of such licenses that may be held by the same owner expires on January 1, 2023.</p>
