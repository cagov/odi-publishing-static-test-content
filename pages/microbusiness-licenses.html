<h2 class="wp-block-post-title has-medium-font-size">Notification: Labor peace agreement</h2>

<div class="is-layout-flow entry-content wp-block-post-content">
<p>This bulletin is to advise state cannabis licensees that the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB) has determined that Professional Technical Union, Local 33 (Pro-Tech 33) is not a bona fide labor organization.</p>

<p>Many state cannabis licensees and applicants for licensure are required to enter into a labor peace agreement with a bona fide labor organization. (See Business and Professions Code, section 26051.5, subdivision (a)(5).) The ALRB is responsible for determining whether an entity is a bona fide labor organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 6, 2023, the ALRB released a determination that Professional Technical Union, Local 33 (Pro-Tech 33) is not a bona fide labor organization for purposes of the labor peace agreement and licensing requirements under Business and Professions Code sections 26001(aa) and 26051.5(a)(5)(D). Therefore, any labor peace agreements entered into by licensees with Pro-Tech 33 are null and void. These agreements can no longer be used to satisfy the requirement for licensees and applicants who must enter into a labor peace agreement.</p>

<p>Licensees who have entered into a labor peace agreement with Pro-Tech 33 will be notified that they are out of compliance with licensure requirements. This notice will specify the date by which must achieve compliance. Licensees are encouraged to begin working to bring themselves into compliance immediately.</p>

<p>For any questions or concerns please contact [CONTACT INFO].</p>

<div class="is-layout-flow entry-content wp-block-post-content">
<p>Follow these steps to safeguard yourself, your business, and your employees from robbery, burglary and theft.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Definitions</h2>

<div class="is-layout-constrained wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<ul>
<li>Robbery: Taking of items by force or fear, such as a bank robbery. </li>

<li>Burglary: Entering a building with the intent to commit a theft, such as a late night break-in.</li>

<li>Theft: Typically committed by employees, like stealing cash from a register.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
</div></div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robbery</h2>

<ul class="step-list">
<li><strong>Maintain visibility into your place of business.</strong> Keep windows clear of signs or merchandise to avoid blocking the view into your business and keep all entrances, exits and parking areas well lit.</li>

<li><strong>Install a hold-up alarm system.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Protect transactional areas.</strong> Place registers at a safe distance from the door and install physical barriers that are high enough to keep unauthorized persons out of the area where cash transactions take place.</li>

<li><strong>Minimize cash on premises</strong>. Keep your on-premise safe out of sight and locked at all times. &nbsp;Make frequent cash drops to keep cash on premises to a minimum. Use a courier service if you’re dropping cash off premises.</li>

<li><strong>Use more than one person</strong> to open and/or close the business.&nbsp;There is safety in numbers.</li>

<li><strong>Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact the authorities</strong>. Post law enforcement emergency and non-emergency phone numbers in a visible location. Call the police immediately if you see something suspicious.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Burglary</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure the premises when closed</strong>. Install high-quality locks and check the condition of the locks on a regular basis. Instruct the last person who leaves the premises to lock all doors and windows and include this step in your written closing instructions. </li>

<li><strong>Install a security system or burglar alarm</strong>. Choose one that includes video surveillance. Check your protection system to make sure it is working properly and have a backup power supply in case of an outage.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Secure valuables</strong>. Remove all merchandise at the end of each day and place merchandise that can&#8217;t be removed in a safe. </li>

<li><strong>Secure your safe.</strong> Keep it out of customer view and bolt it to the floor or find another way to prevent it from being moved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your windows clear</strong>. Don’t tint or obscure your windows. This allows burglars to act out of sight once they are inside your business. Apply a protective film to the windows to make them difficult to break or remove</li>

<li><strong>Keep your building well lit</strong>.&nbsp;Burglars prefer to work in the dark, so installing motion lights on the roof and perimeter of your building can deter suspicious activity.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theft</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>Most theft is committed by employees.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Consider an employee policy of no handbags or backpacks, or only clear bags.</li>

<li>Review your video footage frequently.</li>

<li>Provide each employee with an individual alarm code.</li>

<li>Limit access to your safe.</li>
</ul>
