<h2 class="wp-block-post-title has-medium-font-size">Cannabis Cultivator Self Inspection Checklist</h2>

<div class="is-layout-flow entry-content wp-block-post-content">
<p>This checklist is designed to help you review the conditions of your cannabis cultivation (including nursery or processing) facility in preparation for an inspection by Department of Cannabis Control (Department) staff. The items listed below represent the major areas evaluated during a routine compliance inspection. The requirements come from division 10 of the California Business and Professions Code (BPC) and California Code of Regulations, title 4 (4 CCR), which are available at the Department&#8217;s website: https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/laws-and-regulations/. Please be aware that this checklist is not an exhaustive list or substitute for ensuring compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for your license type. </p>

<h2>Inventory management &amp; track and trace requirements </h2>

<p><sub>(4 CCR §§ 15000.1, 15000.7, 15047.1-15052.1) </sub></p>

<ul>
<li>Immature cannabis plant lots:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Each lot of immature plants contains no more than 100 plants of the same strain.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A plant tag is assigned and placed with each immature lot, and each immature plant lot either (A) has each plant labeled with the UID number and placed contiguous to one another or (B) is fully separated from other immature plant lots by a physical barrier.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Each individual plant in the designated canopy area has a plant tag attached to the main stem near the base of each plant, placed in a position so it is visible and within clear view of an individual standing next to the mature plant, and kept free from dirt and debris.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Harvested plants that are hanging, drying, or curing have been assigned a unique harvest batch name in the track and trace system, and a label with the harvest batch name is placed next to the batch.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Harvest batches that have finished drying, curing, grading, and/or trimming have been assigned a package UID tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>All harvest batches are assigned a package tag that is recorded in the track and trace system. Package tags are affixed to the container holding the cannabis. If cannabis&nbsp; is held in multiple containers, the package tag is affixed to one of the containers and the remaining containers (and units within each container) are labeled with the UID number and placed contiguous to one another.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The following activities have been entered in the track and trace system within 24 hours of each occurrence: receipt of cannabis, rejection of cannabis, use of cannabis or cannabis product for internal quality control testing or product research and development, destruction or disposal of cannabis, packaging or repackaging of cannabis, and sale or donation of cannabis or cannabis products.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The following cultivation activities have been entered in the track and trace system within three (3) calendar days of occurrence: planting of an immature lot, movement of plants to the designated canopy area, flowering of an individual plant, application of an individual plant tag, destruction or disposal of plants, and harvesting of mature plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>On-site cannabis and cannabis product inventory is reconciled with the track and trace system at least once every 30 days.&nbsp;</li>

<li>All transfers of cannabis material or plants onto or off of the cultivation premises are conducted by a licensed distributor, and transfer manifests are created in the track and trace system before the transfer occurs.&nbsp;</li>

<li>All cannabis material is stored within the licensed premises and in an indoor harvest storage area (i.e., no outdoor storage or storage in employee bathroom and changing facilities).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Premises &amp; cultivation plan documents </h2>

<p><sub>(4 CCR §§ 15000, 15006, 15027, 16309) </sub></p>

<ul>
<li>The approved premises diagram on file with the Department is a complete and detailed diagram of the premises and accurately reflects the current layout of the premises. Use the <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Premises-Diagram-Checklist_211022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To: Make a</a> <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Premises-Diagram-Checklist_211022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Premises Diagram Checklist </a>to make sure your premises diagram includes all required information listed in section 15006 of the Department’s regulations.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The approved cannabis waste management and pest management plans on file with the Department accurately reflect the premises’ current operations.&nbsp;</li>

<li>For mixed-light and indoor licenses, the lighting diagram on file with the Department accurately reflects the location and maximum wattage of all lights in the designated canopy area(s), and the average lighting (watts per square foot of canopy) is within the limit of the license type.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Mixed-Light Tier 1: no more than 6 watts per square foot &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Mixed-Light Tier 2: above 6 and no more than 25 watts per square foot&nbsp;</li>

<li>Indoor: More than 25 watts per square foot&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><sub> Note: If lighting fixtures with a range of available wattage are used, use the maximum possible wattage to calculate average lighting. </sub></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<p><strong>Example for a Mixed-Light Tier 2 Cultivation License:</strong> <strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greenhouse with 5 rows of 5’ x 50’ beds = 1,250 square feet of canopy&nbsp;</p>

<p>5 rows of 10 lights x 500 watts per light = 25,000 watts&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Average lighting = (25,000 watts) / (1,250 sq ft) = 20 watts / sq ft </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<ul>
<li>Prior to making alterations to the premises or operations, updated versions of the above documents must be submitted to the Department for review and approval. This can be achieved via the submittal of a <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/calcannabis/training/docs/How-to-Submit-a-ScienceAmendment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Amendment</a> in the Department’s licensing portal.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>No portion of the plants are hanging over the established canopy area boundaries. If plants are overhanging the canopy area boundaries, Department staff or representatives will measure to the outer edge of the plants in order to calculate the total canopy area in use.&nbsp;</li>
