<h2 class="wp-block-post-title has-medium-font-size">Notification: Labor peace agreement</h2>

<div class="is-layout-flow entry-content wp-block-post-content">
<p>This bulletin is to advise state cannabis licensees that the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB) has determined that Professional Technical Union, Local 33 (Pro-Tech 33) is not a bona fide labor organization.</p>

<p>Many state cannabis licensees and applicants for licensure are required to enter into a labor peace agreement with a bona fide labor organization. (See Business and Professions Code, section 26051.5, subdivision (a)(5).) The ALRB is responsible for determining whether an entity is a bona fide labor organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 6, 2023, the ALRB released a determination that Professional Technical Union, Local 33 (Pro-Tech 33) is not a bona fide labor organization for purposes of the labor peace agreement and licensing requirements under Business and Professions Code sections 26001(aa) and 26051.5(a)(5)(D). Therefore, any labor peace agreements entered into by licensees with Pro-Tech 33 are null and void. These agreements can no longer be used to satisfy the requirement for licensees and applicants who must enter into a labor peace agreement.</p>

<p>Licensees who have entered into a labor peace agreement with Pro-Tech 33 will be notified that they are out of compliance with licensure requirements. This notice will specify the date by which must achieve compliance. Licensees are encouraged to begin working to bring themselves into compliance immediately.</p>

<p>For any questions or concerns please contact [CONTACT INFO].</p>
