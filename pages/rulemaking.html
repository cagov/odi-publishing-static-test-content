<h2>DCC Conflict of Interest Code</h2>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Special rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Under review</p>

<p>California law requires all state and local government agencies to establish and follow a Conflict of Interest Code. These codes require agency officials who routinely participate in decisions to publicly disclose personal financial information. They designate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which employee positions must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests</li>

<li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt a Conflict of Interest Code.</p>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code helps identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest.

<div class="is-layout-flow entry-content wp-block-post-content">
<p><strong>Type</strong>: Emergency rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved December 20, 2021</p>

<p>DCC adopted emergency regulations to provide licensing fee waivers to qualified equity businesses statewide. The waivers are designed to assist individuals harmed by the War on Drugs with starting and operating a cannabis business. The regulations implement the fee waiver provisions of&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001o5gXg2WtWHqT5qP2D0F-nSOXc_NXPFQIKULp13NsCQ1C_jHsdXZj_WgAS66TQs62H9ncwJ61Rxc0skFSH71hIblaF8H3sBeg9wONsLJOq_uXL2ahxhnKN7PQXrFYP3VsvisuPXye-lWLjPHgX9yoIwqkebwBeZ822CKoSoLpMWI-NcWjK91ZpLALJ4UXCDS1RIEjkH3QRB_fP8zXPRMly5H8Sz1gUFKmA9YVj9Y3qF0=&amp;c=2JFV7WHTI-jUDtrqhgYhFmoF6sfJsqV_kC9r2iJFzdZGPFQRVLmdeg==&amp;ch=DnKSFVMrGLPbVCUtCEvzsW4MyonQ_ApglixcGJx5JPoeqeyL-0atlA==__;!!AvL6XA!nAHoDsRO17wp6LlixZiJ6jfpQLnboIyv-G-0ll6icK6EvUDpLDcBBwjCU0-fC-vff__hbKWxjw$">Senate Bill 166</a>.</p>

<p>This statewide program provides financial support to cannabis business by waiving licensing fees if applicants and licensees meet the equity eligibility criteria, such as past cannabis convictions or arrests, reduced income or residence in an area disproportionately impacted by past criminal justice policies, as well as other criteria.</p>

<p>The emergency regulations add specificity to eligibility criteria established through SB 166 and establish a process for equity applicants and licensees to request waivers for licensing fees.</p>
