<p>Communities choosing to opt-out of the legal cannabis market, are essentially choosing to opt-in to the illegal cannabis market. Research shows that communities with higher rates of illegal consumption tend to see higher rates of violent crime, endangering residents, families and businesses.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these communities lose out on vital tax revenue to fund youth education prevention, early intervention, and treatment, environmental programs, and public safety.</p>

<p>While state and federal fair labor practices protect laborers in the legal market, workers at illegal cannabis farms may be subjected to wage theft, violence, and hazardous conditions.</p>
